UC Naturalist capstone project

## About
This project was part of the Spring 2021 UC Naturalist course. It consists of all the files needed to create 4 nature experience cards for a couple of locations on the Palos Verdes Peninsula.

Cards are printed on letter size cardstock (two cards per page; cut at 5.75 inches)
